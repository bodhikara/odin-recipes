    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (11o degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2.5 cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li >Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li >Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li >Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li >Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li >Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li >Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li >Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
    <p>You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour makes a superior crust. <br /> If you have a pizza stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</p>
